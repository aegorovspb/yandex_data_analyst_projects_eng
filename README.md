Below is a list of projects completed during training at Yandex Practicum courses, specialty "Data Analyst"

Separately, I want to highlight the project and presentation that seemed to me the most interesting:

[Sales funnel analysis and evaluation of A/A/B testing results](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/08_aab_test_app.ipynb)

Project name |  Project goal    | libraries and tools that are used
-----------------|------------|------------------------
[Bank Borrowers](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/01_bank_borrowers.ipynb) | To find the factors that affect loan return on time. During the project implementation it is necessary to find out whether factors such as marital status, number of children, income level have an impact on the return of the loan. | *Pandas, os*
[Real estate valuation](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/02_real_estate_appraisal.ipynb) | Determining of the market value of real estate objects (based on the Yandex Real estate resource). The goal is to find the characteristics of real estate that affect the most its value. | *Pandas, Matplotlib*
[Determining a favorable tariff for a telecom company](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/03_tariffs_for_telecom_companies.ipynb) | Analysis of two tariffs of a telecom company in order to determine which one brings the highest profit to the company, based on an average per user calculation and in general according to the presented sample. | *Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn, SciPy*
[Successful computer games](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/04_analysis_of_sales_computer_games.ipynb) | A study of historical data on sales of computer games, in order to find patterns in sales based on data up to 2016, in order to give recommendations for planning a marketing budget for 2017. Success in this analysis refers to the number of copies sold. Earned profit and sales volumes are not taken into account due to the lack of incoming data | *Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy*
[Project "Procrastination". Procrastinate Pro+ App Analysis](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/05_procrastinate_app_analysis.ipynb) | It is necessary to find reasons for the application’s low profitability and   unsuccessful advertising campaign. It is necessary to analyze the specifics of the user’s use of the application, the period of the first purchases, the total revenue from each client, the payback period, and what factors negatively affect user acquisition.**LTV, ROI, retention and conversion calculation.** | *Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib*
[Analysis of the A/B test. Identification of hypothesis priority](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/06_аb_test_analisis_app.ipynb) | We have to prioritize hypotheses to increase sales put forward jointly with the marketing department. The main goal of the project is to decide on the feasibility of further testing. | *Pandas, Matplotlib, Math, Numpy, SciPy*
[Cafe "ROBOTS". Moscow catering market research](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/07_cafe_robots_in_moscov.ipynb) | We have open data on public catering establishments in Moscow. The main goal of the project is to evaluate the Moscow catering market and assess the long-term prospects of opening a new cafe where visitors will be served by robots. | *Pandas, Matplotlib, Math, Numpy, Plotly, Seaborn, SciPy*
[Project "Sales funnel". Analysis of A/A/B test results](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/08_aab_test_app.ipynb) | Analysis of the sales funnel and evaluation of the results of A/A/B testing. We need to find out which of the tested fonts increases sales. During the analysis, it is necessary to select additional criteria for evaluating fonts. | *Pandas, Matplotlib, Math, Numpy, Plotly, Seaborn, SciPy*
[Machine Learning](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/09_machine_learning.ipynb) | Forecasting the probability of customer churn of the network of fitness centers. Project goal: to develop a strategy of interaction with customers in the network of fitness centers "Kulturist" on the basis of analytical data | *Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SciPy*
[Evaluation of the results of the A/B test. Sales funnel](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/10_ab_test_analysis_sales_funnel.ipynb) | Assessment of the correctness of the A/B-test and analysis of its results | *Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Plotly*
[Analysis of the mobile game "Space Brothers"](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/11_space_brothers.ipynb) | Educational project made on the basis of the provided sample of real data from the mobile game ["Space Brothers"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqK6iCaiuL8). In the course of the study, two main tasks were solved: analysis of user behavior depending on the source of the transition, development of recommendations for building the monetization of the game. | *Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Plotly*
[The Book Business Project](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/12_sql.ipynb) | Implementation of unloading from the database, containing information about books, publishers, authors, as well as custom book reviews, in accordance with customer requests | *Pandas, SQL*
[Presentation "SALE FUNNEL"](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/tree/main/08_aab_test_presentation) | Presentation for project "Sales funnel". | *Adobe Illustrator*
