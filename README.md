Below is a list of projects completed during training at Yandex Practicum courses, specialty "Data Analyst"

Separately, I want to highlight the project and presentation that seemed to me the most interesting:

[Sales funnel analysis and evaluation of A/A/B testing results](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/08_aab_test_app.ipynb)

[Presentation "SALE FUNNEL"](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/tree/main/08_aab_test_presentation)


Project name |  Project goal    | libraries and tools that are used
-----------------|------------|------------------------
[Bank Borrowers](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/01_bank_borrowers.ipynb) | Find factors that affect loan repayment on time. During the implementation of the project, it is necessary to find out whether factors such as marital status, number of children, income level have an impact on the return of the loan. | *Pandas, os*
[Real estate valuation](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/02_real_estate_appraisal.ipynb) | Determination of the market value of real estate objects (based on the Yandex resource.Real estate). The goal is to find the characteristics of real estate that most affect its value. | *Pandas, Matplotlib*
[Determining a favorable tariff for a telecom company](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/03_tariffs_for_telecom_companies.ipynb) | Analysis of two tariffs of a telecom company, in order to determine which one brings a large profit to the company based on an average per user and in general according to the presented sample | *Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn, SciPy*
[Successful computer games](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/04_analysis_of_sales_computer_games.ipynb) | A study of historical data on sales of computer games, in order to find patterns in sales based on data up to 2016, in order to give recommendations for planning an advertising budget for 2017. Success in this analysis refers to the number of copies sold. Earned profit and sales volumes are not taken into account due to the lack of incoming data | *Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy*
[Project "Procrastination". Procrastinate Pro+ App Analysis](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/05_procrastinate_app_analysis.ipynb) | It is necessary to find possible reasons for the lack of profit for the application and the unprofitability of the advertising company. It is necessary to analyze the features of the userâ€™s use of the application, the period of the first purchases, the total revenue from each client, the payback period, and what factors negatively affect user acquisition. **LTV, ROI, retention and conversion calculation.** | *Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib*
[Project "Sales funnel". Analysis of A/A/B test results](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/08_aab_test_app.ipynb) | Analysis of the sales funnel and evaluation of the results of A/A/B testing. We need to find out which of the tested fonts increases sales. During the analysis, it is necessary to select additional criteria for evaluating fonts. | *Pandas, Matplotlib, Math, Numpy, Plotly, Seaborn, SciPy*
[Analysis of the mobile game "Space Brothers"](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/08_aab_test_app.ipynb) | Educational project made on the basis of the provided sample of real data from the mobile game ["Space Brothers"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqK6iCaiuL8). In the course of the study, two main tasks were solved: analysis of user behavior depending on the source of the transition, development of recommendations for building the monetization of the game. | *Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Plotly*
[Presentation "SALE FUNNEL"](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/tree/main/08_aab_test_presentation) | Presentation for project "Sales funnel". | *Adobe Illustrator*
