Below is a list of projects completed during training at Yandex Practicum courses, specialty "Data Analyst"

Separately, I want to highlight the project and presentation that seemed to me the most interesting:

[Sales funnel analysis and evaluation of A/A/B testing results](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/08_aab_test_app.ipynb)

[Presentation "SALE FUNNEL"](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/tree/main/08_aab_test_presentation)
